# 🔢 High-Low Guessing Game

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this game is to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.  
After each guess, the game provides **hints** — whether your guess is too high, too low, or if the number is **odd** or **even** — to help guide you to the correct answer.  

The game keeps track of:
- ✅ Wins
- ❌ Losses
- 🔁 Retries
- 🔥 Current Streak
- 🔄 Total Rounds Played

- The computer randomly generates a number within a given range of 0 to 1000.
- The player attempts to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game must display:
  - A hint if the number is **too high** or **too low**.
  - A hint whether the number is **odd** or **even**.
- The player continues guessing until:
  - They guess correctly (**win**).
  - They choose to **quit**. (clears the stats and goes to AOIT Website)
  - They reach the maximum number of allowed retries (**loss**).

- **Retries:** Count how many times the player repeats the round after losing.
- **Rounds Played:** Count total rounds started.
- **Streak:** Track consecutive wins. (if possible)
